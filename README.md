## 🔎 What is Caffeine for Mac?

**Caffeine for Mac** is a minimal, single-purpose app that stops your Mac from automatically sleeping, dimming the display, or starting the screen saver. It’s perfect for users who need their computer to stay awake during long processes like downloads, backups, coding, or presentations.

When you run the app, a coffee cup icon appears in your Mac’s menu bar. Clicking the icon toggles the app’s behavior – a full cup means your Mac will stay awake, an empty cup means sleep mode is enabled as usual.

Caffeine uses almost no system resources and doesn’t interfere with performance. It’s an ideal tool for users who want simple functionality without bloated software or complicated settings. Whether you're working on a project, watching a video, or preventing timeouts, Caffeine is your no-fuss companion for staying awake.

It also supports modern macOS versions including **macOS Monterey**, **Ventura**, **Sonoma**, and Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3).
